The Git Workflow is a process to validate a task specially for Open Source projects, and even for private projects.

They have a workflow of how to integrate projects between distributed teams using the Git version control.

## Our workflow

We use the contribution process in a git repository to validate work. GIT is our smart contract. From a change request that is checked with automated tests and validation in several environments, and then we validate the code integration from team work.

## Git Workflow

Git workflow is the guideline we use to deliver tasks from projects consistently and effective.

Working in a project, when we use git as our version control system, we have a workflow to work as a team in the codebase. With git we can scale teams to work on our codebase, and the workflow goes from open an issue from closed by a Pull Request.

There's many workflow for teams using git, and here we will talk about what we use on Gitpay and a process used by many companies worldwide.


> Workflow are ways to present the work process in agile development. They are based in project guidelines using git as version control system.

## Forking Workflow

This is the forking workflow used to integrated the code of our projects. In this forking workflow, repositories can be created from the main source, and one of them is your changes. You should be able to create a new environment to reproduce and then do the changes and conclude the task. 

Every change has their own approval process. This process follow agile guidelines and good development practices.

## Validating changes

We validate your changes with the following guidelines:

1. We may avoid go into details, and we will evaluate the value of the task you're delivering
2. We will be flexible to discuss best solutions, whatever, a well written issue and described will avoid unnecessary scope disorder
3. We use agile development, and we incite the development with automated tests, specially to fix bugs.
