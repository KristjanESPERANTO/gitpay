When a task is concluded, and the related issue is closed, and the Pull Request was closed in a continuous integration system and the code send to production, you receive a reward as payment.

I will explain better how this works in the following stages:

## Investing in an issue as a bounty
An issue imported to Gitpay available in our platform can have a bounty added as a payment for the ones interested in their resolution. Maybe it is a client, or who keeps the project or a set of sponsors that together will support to solve something for a third party, in a model known as *crowdfunding*

When we have some fund added to our platform, that value was paid in case of credit card, and pre-paid as a Paypal payment. You can apply to solve that work. In order to receive that payment, you need to activate your account, checking our bank details to receive directly as bank transfer.

> When we have a bounty added for a task, someone paid to evaluate that solution and approve your changes to send the bounty.

## Payments with credit-card: receive direct in your bank account
When we send a payment for an issue solved, a new order is created. If it was paid by credit card, the payment is send when the code is merged.

For this kind of payment, you need to have an active bank account, and this can be done in the platform to receive the payments. When activated, the payment is send and it takes approximately *2 days to be send*

> To receive the transfer there's a fee of 8% for the transaction, in USD, and the currency is defined by Stripe terms.

## Payments with Paypal: receive payments to your Paypal account
The payments done with Paypal, you will need to activate your Paypal account to receive the payment. The paymnent will be adjusted with the Paypal taxes.

> If you use Paypal and you want to receive a payment with paypal, please verify that the payment was done using Paypal


## Payments done with Credit Card and Paypal
If there's many orders for that task and if there's different payment methods. To receive the full amount, you will need your bank account and a Paypal account active.
